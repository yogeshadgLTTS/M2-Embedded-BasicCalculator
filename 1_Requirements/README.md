# Requirements

## Introduction

The purpose of the project is to build a simple calculator based on microcontroller ATMEGA328. This simple calculator which can perform Signed operations on 64bits numbers with max of two different math symbols or any number of operands but with the same math symbol. It uses 4×4 matrix keyboard as input device with a 74C922 decoder. This decoder generates an interrupt through External Interrupt INT0 every time a key is pressed. The result of calculation displayed on 16×2 LCD. MCU firmware is written in C language and is compiled using WinAVR.
