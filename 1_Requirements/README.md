# Requirements

## Introduction

* The purpose of the project is to build a simple calculator based on microcontroller ATMEGA328. This simple calculator which can perform Signed operations on 64bits numbers with max of two different math symbols or any number of operands but with the same math symbol. It uses 4×4 matrix keyboard as input device with a 74C922 decoder. This decoder generates an interrupt through External Interrupt INT0 every time a key is pressed. The result of calculation displayed on 16×2 LCD. 

* An LCD module can be interfaced with a microcontroller either in 8 bit mode or in 4 bit mode.  8 bit mode is the conventional mode which uses 8 data lines and RS, R/W, E pins for functioning. However 4 bit mode uses only 4 data lines along with the control pins. This will saves the number of GPIO pins needed for other purpose.
